          <h2 id="the-idea">The Idea</h2>
          <p>
            Molt Code is a desktop environment tailored for AI-assisted software development. The core idea is simple: you should be able to kick off work, go read a book, and come back to real progress. The app manages AI agents, organises your projects, and handles the tedious parts so you don't have to babysit every step.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not another chat interface bolted onto an editor. It's a purpose-built workspace where AI agents run as managed processes — you see everything they do, control what they have access to, and let them operate independently across multiple projects at once.
          </p>

          <h2 id="why-a-desktop-app">Why a Desktop App?</h2>
          <p>
            AI coding agents live in your terminal. You run Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini CLI in a shell, and the conversation disappears as soon as you close it. If you're working across five projects with multiple agents, you end up with a mess of terminal tabs, no organisation, and no way to see what's happening at a glance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Molt Code solves this by giving you a single place to manage it all. Projects on the left, conversations in the centre, agent output in real time. Everything is persistent — close the app, reopen it, and your sessions are exactly where you left them.
          </p>

          <h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>
          <p>
            When you open Molt Code, you see your projects, recent sessions, and features. Pick a project, start a chat, and the AI agent spins up as a managed subprocess. You can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Run multiple agents</strong> — across different projects, at the same time, each in its own session.</li>
            <li><strong>Group work into features</strong> — a feature ties related sessions together across projects, so "API redesign" has its backend and frontend conversations in one place.</li>
            <li><strong>Experiment across models</strong> — send the same prompt to Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini in parallel and compare the results before committing to an approach.</li>
            <li><strong>Write docs and PRDs</strong> — each project has a knowledge base that agents can reference during sessions, keeping implementation aligned with intent.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="what-makes-it-different">What Makes It Different</h2>

          <h3>You bring your own keys</h3>
          <p>
            Molt Code doesn't proxy your API requests or require a subscription. You configure your own API keys for Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or any other provider. The keys stay on your machine, requests go directly to the provider. No middleman.
          </p>

          <h3>Agents are processes, not plugins</h3>
          <p>
            Each agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) runs as its own subprocess. Molt Code manages the lifecycle — start, stop, restart, monitor. When an agent is done, it terminates cleanly. No idle processes eating RAM in the background.
          </p>

          <h3>Full visibility</h3>
          <p>
            Every tool call, every file edit, every decision the agent makes is visible in real time. You're not guessing what happened — you can see the entire chain of actions, approve or deny tool calls, and step in when needed.
          </p>

          <h3>Built for the multi-project reality</h3>
          <p>
            Most developers don't work on one project at a time. Molt Code is designed around this — switch between projects instantly, run agents in parallel, and keep everything organised without terminal tab chaos.
          </p>

          <h2 id="who-its-for">Who It's For</h2>
          <p>
            Molt Code is for developers who use AI coding agents seriously. If you've found yourself juggling terminal sessions, losing context between conversations, or wishing you could just hand off a task and come back to it later — that's exactly the problem this solves.
          </p>
          <p>
            It works on macOS and runs locally on your machine. Your code, your keys, your data — nothing leaves your computer unless you send it to an AI provider.
