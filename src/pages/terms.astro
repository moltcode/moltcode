      <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By downloading, installing, or using Molt Code, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the software.
      </p>

      <h2>Description of Service</h2>
      <p>
        Molt Code is a free desktop application that provides a workspace for managing AI coding agents. The app is provided "as is" for individual use.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for your own API keys and any costs incurred with third-party AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.).</li>
        <li>You are responsible for the code generated by AI agents and its use in your projects.</li>
        <li>You must comply with the terms of service of any third-party AI providers you connect to through Molt Code.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>API Keys &amp; Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Molt Code does not provide AI services directly. You bring your own API keys, and requests are sent directly from your machine to the respective providers. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or behavior of third-party AI services.
      </p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        Molt Code and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by Molt Code. The software is made available for your use under these terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any code you write or generate using Molt Code belongs to you. We make no claim over your projects, code, or AI-generated output.
      </p>

      <h2>No Warranty</h2>
      <p>
        Molt Code is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the software will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, Molt Code shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of profits, or business interruption, arising out of or in connection with your use of the software.
      </p>

      <h2>Clustering Service (Future)</h2>
      <p>
        The paid Clustering feature, when available, will be subject to additional terms that will be provided at launch.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of Molt Code after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you have questions about these terms, open an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/moltcode/moltcode" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.
